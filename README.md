# Oleh Borysovskyy Cybersecurity Lab

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab repository! This project is dedicated to showcasing my hands-on work in cybersecurity, including penetration testing, red team exercises, and my preparation for the CompTIA Security+ (701) exam.

## üöÄ Lab Components

- **Recon Logs**: Includes reconnaissance and information gathering methods (e.g., Nmap scans, OSINT, etc.).
- **Exploitation**: Details on exploiting vulnerabilities found in the lab, including reverse shells, privilege escalation, and payload creation.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Methods for maintaining access, gathering further information, and lateral movement within the lab network.
- **Hardening**: Best practices for securing systems and services within the lab, ensuring protection against attacks.
- **SIEM/IDS**: Setup and configuration of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for monitoring and alerting.
- **Reports**: Formal lab reports, including penetration testing findings, recommendations, and remediation steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup

### **Cybersecurity Home Lab Configuration**
- **Target Systems**:
  - Windows Server 2025 (Active Directory, Sysmon, SSH enabled)
  - Kali Linux (Attacker machine)
  - Windows 11 Pro (Remote control via RDP)
  - Windows 7 VM (Simulating lateral movement)
  
- **Network**:
  - Dedicated, isolated network (192.168.1.0/24 subnet)
  - Netgear router (192.168.1.1) as the gateway
  - Wired Ethernet connection
  
### **Security Tools Utilized**:
- **Kali Linux**: For penetration testing tools and frameworks.
- **Metasploit**: For generating payloads and performing exploits.
- **Nmap**: For network discovery and vulnerability scanning.
- **Nikto**: For web server scans.
- **Wazuh SIEM**: For real-time security monitoring and event analysis.
- **Suricata IDS**: For detecting intrusions and monitoring network traffic.

## üìö Goal

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate my skills in:
- Penetration testing (ethical hacking)
- Security monitoring and incident response
- System hardening and mitigation of security risks

This project will evolve as I continue to build on my lab and complete my **CompTIA Security+ 701** study plan.
